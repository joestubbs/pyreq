pyreqs
======
Utility to determine the 3rd-party packages of a specific python script. Can combine with nbconvert to analyze jupyter notebooks as well.


High-Level Algorithm: 

1. Convert the jupyter notebook file to a python script. This can be achieved with nbcovert:
  $ jupyter-nbconvert --to script /path/to/nb.ipynb

2. Use python modulefinder class to analysis the modules used in the script (see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/modulefinder.html)

3. Check the list generated in Step 2 against the list of known modules from the standard library. 
This step requires knowing the specific version of the standard library we want to check against. The stdlib_list package can be used 
here (https://pypi.org/project/stdlib-list/).
